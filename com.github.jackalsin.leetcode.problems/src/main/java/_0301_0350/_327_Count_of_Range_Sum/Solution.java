   * Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
   * Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤
   * j), inclusive.
   * <p>
   * Note:
   * A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
   * <p>
   * Example:
   * Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
   * Return 3.
   * The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

   * Special thanks to @dietpepsi for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
