   *
   * the total distance of the slow pointer traveled when encounter is L1 + L2
   * the total distance of the fast pointer traveled when encounter is L1 + L2 + n * C
   * Because the total distance the fast pointer traveled is twice as the slow pointer, Thus:
   * 2 * (L1+L2) = L1 + L2 + n * C => L1 + L2 = n * C => L1 = (n - 1) C + (C - L2)
   * It can be concluded that the distance between the head location and entry location is equal to
   * the distance between the meeting location and the entry location along the direction of
   * forward movement.
   *
   * So, when the slow pointer and the fast pointer encounter in the cycle, we can define a
   * pointer "entry" that point to the head, this "entry" pointer moves one step each time so as
   * the slow pointer. When this "entry" pointer and the slow pointer both point to the same
   * location, this location is the node where the cycle begins.
   * @param head
   * @return
