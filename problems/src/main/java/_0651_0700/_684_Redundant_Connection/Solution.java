   * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
   * The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.
   * The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that
   * represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.
   * <p>
   * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple
   * answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.
