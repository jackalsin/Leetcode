/**
 * Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least
 * one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you
 * need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
 * The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same
 * sentence before.
 * The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one).
 * If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
 * If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
 * When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need
 * to return an empty list.
 * Your job is to implement the following functions:
 * The constructor function:
 * AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is
 * historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is
 * the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.
 * Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next
 * character the user types:
 * List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character
 * will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#').
 * Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be
 * the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Operation: AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
 * The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
 * "i love you" : 5 times
 * "island" : 3 times
 * "ironman" : 2 times
 * "i love leetcode" : 2 times
 * Now, the user begins another search:
 * <p>
 * Operation: input('i')
 * Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]
 * Explanation:
 * There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have
 * same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode"
 * should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so
 * "ironman" will be ignored.
 * <p>
 * Operation: input(' ')
 * Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"]
 * Explanation:
 * There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
 * <p>
 * Operation: input('a')
 * Output: []
 * Explanation:
 * There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
 * <p>
 * Operation: input('#')
 * Output: []
 * Explanation:
 * The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in
 * system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space
 * will exist between two words.
 * The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each
 * sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
 * Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character
 * input.
 * Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as
 * static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Solution 43 / 43 test cases passed.
 * Status: Accepted
 * Runtime: 380 ms
