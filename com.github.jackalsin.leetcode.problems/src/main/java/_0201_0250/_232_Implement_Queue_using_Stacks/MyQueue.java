/**
 * push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty.
 * Explanation:
 *  I have one input stack, onto which I push the incoming elements, and one output stack, from
 *  which I peek/pop. I move elements from input stack to output stack when needed, i.e., when I
 *  need to peek/pop but the output stack is empty. When that happens, I move all elements from
 *  input to output stack, thereby reversing the order so it's the correct order for peek/pop.
 *
 * The loop in peek does the moving from input to output stack. Each element only ever gets moved
 * like  that once, though, and only after we already spent time pushing it, so the overall
 * amortized  cost for each operation is O(1).
